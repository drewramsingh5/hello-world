Tutorial

I am a first-year graduate student in the Data Mining and Predictive Analytics program at St. John's University. Having obtained a Bachelor's degree in Actuarial Science, I aspire to be a proficient worker in programming and Big Data.

Along with academic pursuits, I work in the Division of Student Affairs as a Graduate Assistant and I continue to develop my interpersonal and soft skills. I am actively seeking a summer internship to gain applicable, professional experience.
